OOA Pattern Lab
Create two model fragments called values and references. Place the classes below into these fragments. (Some may be enumerations.) Thoroughly research these classes so you can provide enough details so that they will be reusable in semiÂ­-real business applications. 

Reusable Value Classes 
	1.	Quantity 
	2.	Money 
	3.	Time (don't use Java's Date or Calendar. This is the time of a meeting, expiration date, or dob. It's tricky.) 
	4.	Telephone (i.e., telephone number) 
	5.	Address 
	6.	Email (i.e., email address) 
	7.	Gender (M, F, etc?) 
	8.	Title (for addressing letters, say) 
	9.	Ethnicity (for HR applications) 

Reusable Reference Classes 
  10. Person
  11. Customer
  12. Credit Card (maybe this is a value object)
